help diary
 <strong>diary</strong> Save text of MATLAB session.
    <strong>diary</strong> FILENAME causes a copy of all subsequent command window input
    and most of the resulting command window output to be appended to the
    named file.  If no file is specified, the file 'diary' is used.
 
    <strong>diary</strong> OFF suspends it. 
    <strong>diary</strong> ON turns it back on.
    <strong>diary</strong>, by itself, toggles the diary state.
 
    Use the functional form of <strong>diary</strong>, such as <strong>diary</strong>('file'),
    when the file name is stored in a string.
